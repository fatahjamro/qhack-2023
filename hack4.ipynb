    "Welcome to the QHack 2023 daily challenges! Every day for the next four days, you will receive two new challenges to complete. These challenges are worth no points — they are specifically designed to get your brain active and into the right mindset for the competition. You will also learn about various aspects of PennyLane that are essential to quantum computing, quantum machine learning, and quantum chemistry. Have fun!\n",

    "Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon that leads to unique statistical properties. We can harness it to do seemingly far-fetched tasks like quantum teleportation!\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a multi-qubit pure state (i.e., does not need to be described by a density operator), the presence of entanglement boils down to whether or not the state is a product state. Given a two-qubit state where the qubits are labelled by A and B, a general pure quantum state can be written as\n",

    "For example, the well-known Bell states cannot be written as product states between the two qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to create a function that can tell whether or not a pure state can be written as a product state between a subsystem and its complement (e.g., if A is the subsystem, then B=A', meaning that system B is the set of qubits that are not in A).\n",
